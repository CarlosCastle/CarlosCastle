- 👋 Hi, I’m Carlos Castle
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to make software, such as TAS software for games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to operate GitHub.. (:)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my ideas, and if there is TAS software that is universal for games.
- 📫 How to reach me is to email me at "castlecarlos187@gmail.com", and I should get back to you in at most a few days.
